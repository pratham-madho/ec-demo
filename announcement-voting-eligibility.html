        <div class="content">
            <p>
                The Election Commission, in accordance with its mandate to uphold the principles of fair and transparent elections, hereby issues the following official notice regarding the voting eligibility of Integrated First Degree Students admitted in the academic year 2025 for the upcoming Students' Union elections.
            </p>

            <h2>Eligibility Restrictions</h2>
            <p>
                After conducting a thorough investigation and engaging with stakeholders of various backgrounds and interests, the Election Commission has once again decided to disallow the Integrated First Degree Students admitted in the year 2025 from voting in the Students' Union elections for the offices of General Secretary and President of the Students' Union. However, they remain a part of the electorate for the elections to all other posts in the Union Council, including Hostel Representatives and Day Scholar Representatives, and may contest the elections for these posts as well.
            </p>

            <h2>Rationale</h2>
            <p>
                We maintain that it is of utmost priority for the Students' Union and its organs to ensure a safe and welcoming environment for students on campus and to further prevent reprobate individuals from taking advantage of their inexperience or leveraging their power dynamic as "seniors" to gather votes. This decision is in keeping with the spirit of the Constitution of the Students' Union, which mandates that all campaigning be done in an unobtrusive and merit-led manner. A review of past editions led to the establishment of a consistent pattern of first-year students being subjected to unethical campaigning.
            </p>
            <p>A few select instances of such are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Physical and verbal abuse</li>
                <li>Campaigning at inappropriate times</li>
                <li>Intimidation and threats of violence or exclusion</li>
                <li>False promises related to campus commitments</li>
                <li>Confiscation of phones to prevent recording</li>
                <li>Coercion through spam messages on social media</li>
                <li>Persuasion with intoxicants</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Enhancing the First-Year Experience</h2>
            <p>
                The paramount objective behind this injunction is to promote a healthy political environment for first-year students on campus by shielding them from negative political experiences. It has been observed in previous election cycles that first-year students are particularly vulnerable to political malpractices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, it has been observed that most candidates' campaigns revolve around improving the quality of life for first-year students and are less catered to students in their 2nd year or above. We believe that this move should incentivise candidates to pitch for initiatives in the interests of these students in hopes of creating and fostering a better student environment at BITS Pilani.
            </p>
            <p>
                This move is a decisive step towards preserving the integrity of Students' Union elections. The Election Commission is committed towards creating a campus environment where elections are fought on the basis of ideas, policies, and merit, not coercion or fear. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> The Election Commission seeks to take multiple steps to ensure that all General Body Members are aware of their rights and responsibilities during the elections and have access to ways to report and resolve their grievances effectively. Further information regarding this will be communicated in due time.
